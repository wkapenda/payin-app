# Payin App

The **Payin App** is a modern, responsive hosted payment page application built using Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. This project demonstrates best practices in building interactive, component-based web applications with efficient state management and API integration.

The application simulates a complete payment journey using a sandbox API provided via Postman. It includes an Accept Quote page, a Pay Quote page, and an Expiry page, and implements auto-refresh, currency selection, and copy-to-clipboard functionality.
